Musicube is a music streaming application, which can play music and stream audio both stored locally on your device or from the web. Musicbe uses youtube api's to source playlists and songs from the internet and plays them in the embedded youtube window inside the app. 
The musicube ux is inspired from the themes of gaana, apple music and jiomusic. We have used a red colour which provides a soothing feeling to the user. The embedded features such as play, pause, skip and rewind enhance the user experience even better. We have also added an autoplay feature which allows the user to put on his favourite genre and keep listening to endless playlists. The display artist and song name features uses ai to track song information from the internet and provide data about the track being played. The ai enabled feature also uses metadata to identify the user's interests and generate an algorithm based on his mood and interests. The youtube search feature allows you to search any music on the internet. The in built sound control feature allows the user to easily control the volume through the app itself.
On later versions we can add features such as user login to save informations such as language preferences, favourite artists, etc.
We wish you  happy music streaming experience. Made with love @mobashsharfaiz.
